		<!--Russian Backgrounds-->
		<String key="VVS_PilotBackground0">Raised in a textile district of Ivanovo, {name} was the {son_or_daughter} of a mill worker and learned to fly through the local OSOAVIAKhIM club. After the German invasion, {pronoun_he} volunteered for service, driven by a deep sense of duty and outrage over the bombing of {his_her} hometown. Known for {his_her} discipline and mechanical aptitude, {pronoun_he} quickly adapted to military aviation under the VVS.</String>
		<String key="VVS_PilotBackground1">Before the war, {name} served as a civilian glider instructor near Kazan and had earned respect for {his_her} calm demeanor and teaching skill.

		<String key="VVS_PilotBackground4">{name} was the {son_or_daughter} of a tram driver in Leningrad and a schoolteacher. {Pronoun_he} had briefly joined a local aero club before the war and showed talent for piloting. During the siege, {pronoun_he} helped carry supplies and bodies through freezing streets, witnessing the brutal cost of the war firsthand. {Pronoun_he} lost two younger siblings during that winter, an experience that shaped {his_her} determination. Flying became more than a dream, it was a form of retaliation.</String>
		<String key="VVS_PilotBackground5">Hailing from a small village near Omsk, {name} had never seen an aircraft up close until enlisting. {Pronoun_he} spent {his_her} early years hunting with {his_her} grandfather and helping maintain farming tools.
